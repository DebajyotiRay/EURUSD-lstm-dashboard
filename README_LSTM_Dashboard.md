# EURUSD LSTM Market Prediction Dashboard 🧠📈

This project is a web-based dashboard that visualizes EURUSD price predictions generated by a trained **LSTM model** using **PyTorch**. The application is powered by **Flask** on the backend and **Chart.js** for interactive charting on the frontend.

> 🔄 The dashboard automatically updates predictions every 30 seconds using live market data (via MetaTrader 5).
